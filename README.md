# ESP32 Smart Switch Control with SinricPro

This project provides a way to control switches using an ESP32 and the SinricPro platform. You can manage multiple switches, get real-time status updates, and control your devices remotely using the SinricPro service.

## Features

- Control up to 4 relays using an ESP32.
- Monitor switch states and toggle relays via physical switches.
- Real-time remote control using SinricPro.
- Debouncing to ensure accurate switch state changes.
- Debugging support for easier development and troubleshooting.
